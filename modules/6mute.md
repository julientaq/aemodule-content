This module allows you to mute up to a maximum of 6 independent channels via the press of a button. It will not put any clicks or noise in an audio signal.

### Inputs

*   **IN 1** to **IN 6** - accepts any CV or audio signal controlled by the relevant numbered button below.

### Outputs

*   **Out 1** to **Out 6** - No signal if the relevant numbered button is lit, signal from the same number input if not.

### Controls

*   **1** to **6** buttons - controls whether the signal at the same number input is allowed through to the same number output. E.g. Button 4 controls the signal from input 4 to output 4.

### Patch Suggestions

The most obvious use is for dropping in and out separate parts of your AE audio in a live situation.

It can be excellent used in conjunction with a rhythm patch to drop a percussion sound in/out which can totally change the feel of the groove. This could be one sound from the [Drum Kit Module](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/DRUMKIT010), one from the [Kick Module](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/KICK) and sounds from the [Algodrone Module](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/ALGODRONE) amongst others

Muting any sort of CV signal can be useful; a good example is pitch modulation (vibrato) on/off. Another is an offset voltage which opens or closes the filter depending on the mute switch position. There are many, many others...

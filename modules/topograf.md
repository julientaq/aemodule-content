TOPOGRAF is a drum sequencer with three tracks, that works with a "topographic" principle; it contains a number of drum patterns arranged in a "virtual map"; and with two knobs MAP X and MAP Y you can set a position in this map. With one knob per channel the density is defined; and a CHAOS knob brings some randomness into the whole process. All in all a few knobs for a lot of drum patterns you probably wouldn't make this way by yourself - a nice source of inspiration and alo great for playing live.

TOPOGRAF is the AE modular version of the Grids module by Mutable Instruments. It is 100% identical to Grids. The user manual for that module can be found here. [https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/manual/](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/manual/)

Module power consumption: 20 mA

### Inputs

*   **CLK** - this is a trigger input, you will need a divider module to control via midi clock and the Master module, see also advanced settings/modes below.
*   **Reset** - Sets back to step 1 of the trigger sequence being played, and keeps sync with other triggered items if needed.
*   **X CV** - In most cases this would be the trigger pattern over the steps of the "sequence" for track 1, although really it does more than this... Combined with the Map X Knob position.
*   **Y CV** - In most cases this would be the trigger pattern over the steps of the "sequence" for tracks 2 and 3, although really it does more than this... Combined with the Map Y Knob position.
*   **Chaos CV** - This will affect the amount of randomness in the Topograph's outputs depending on its level.
*   **CH 1 CV** - This is combined with the Knob 1 position for the amount Output 1 will be triggered in the pattern.
*   **CH2 CV** - This is combined with the Knob 2 position for the amount Output 2 will be triggered in the pattern.
*   **CH3 CV** - This is combined with the Knob 3 position for the amount Output 3 will be triggered in the pattern.

To understand these inputs more clearly the Grids manual is recommended.

### Outputs

*   **TR 1** - Track 1's output, the pattern is dependent on the X,Y setting, and the amount of triggers in the pattern are set by the CH1 CV and Knob 1.
*   **TR 2** -Track 1's output, the pattern is dependent on the X,Y setting, and the amount of triggers in the pattern are set by the CH2 CV and Knob 2.
*   **TR 3** -Track 1's output, the pattern is dependent on the X,Y setting, and the amount of triggers in the pattern are set by the CH3 CV and Knob 3.
*   **ACC1** - Extra trigger(s) on track 1 dependent on the pattern being used, (X,Y setting).
*   **ACC2** - Extra trigger(s) on track 2 dependent on the pattern being used, (X,Y setting).
*   **ACC3** - Extra trigger(s) on track 3 dependent on the pattern being used, (X,Y setting).

### Controls

Detailed explanations of the various controls are given in this video.

*   **RATE** - if no external clock is given in **CLK** then this knob controls the clock rate of the sequence
*   **MAP X** - selects the X position on the map of patterns
*   **MAP Y** - selects the Y position on the map of patterns
*   **CHAOS** - adds randomness to the pattern. Turn right for more randomness.
*   **FILL 1 - 3** these control the fill of triggers for each track. Turned completely anti-clockwise will mute that track.

### Advanced Settings and Modes

The Topograf has the exact same program as MI Grids and the manual for Grids (see above) can be used. However here is a detailed explanation of the different advanced settings and modes.

#### Changing the clock resolution

You can change the clock resolution on the Topograf like this:

*   unplug all CV and hold the TAP (RESET) button for a second to put the Topograph into advanced settings mode
*   the FILL1 knob changes the clock resolution which you can as a pattern on the 3 LEDs
*   4ppqn = first LED is on
*   8ppqn = second LED is on
*   24ppqn = third LED is on
*   Turn the FILL1 knob to select the resolution you want
*   Hold the TAP (RESET) button again for a second to save the settings

You can experiment with 4 or 8 ppqn, but 24 ppqn is usually only useful if you want to clock the TOPOGRAPH directly from the MIDI bus.

The following video explains the advanced configuration options. [https://youtu.be/GLRYptx4Zmg](https://youtu.be/GLRYptx4Zmg)

### Patch Suggestions

Gaetan from the forum [suggests](http://forum.aemodular.com/post/3554/thread):

**Example for a bass line**

*   Trigger the envelope generator of your voice with the topograph's kick
*   Patch the same kick trigger to your [SEQ16](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/SEQ16) clock
*   Patch the [SEQ16](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/SEQ16) to control the pitch of your bass line

Now, every time topograph sends a kick, your sequence will advance one step.

**More fun**

*   [AND](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/LOGIC) together the kick and snare, and use them to trigger your voice's EG
*   Use the hihat to clock the [SEQ16](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/SEQ16)

You're going to have some pretty groovy bass lines with that

**Or for a melody**

*   Clock your [SEQ16](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/SEQ16) with a regular clock, and send the output to a [Sample & Hold](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/SAMPLEHOLD)
*   [AND](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/LOGIC) the HH and the kick, and use it to trigger both your voice's EG and the S&H
*   Use the output of the S&H as you voice's pitch

You'll have a stable melody that will skip steps according to the state of the Topograf

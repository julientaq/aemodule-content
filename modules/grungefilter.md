The Polivoks was a Russian synth that was produced between 1982 and 1990.The GRUNGE FILTER is the AE version of the filter that gave the Polivoks a unique, rough sound.

Beyond the basic design, this filter offers some additional features:

*   two different resonance characteristics, hard and soft
*   an FM function, that adds the input signal to the modulation of the filter
*   an optional overdrive for the output, making the sound even more rough and untamed.
    
*   Power Consumption: 2mA
*   Module width: 1U

### Inputs

*   **IN H** - this input is for higher level signals.
*   **IN L** - this input adds some gain to give a higher signal level of the module circuitry, (i.e. low input signals).
*   **CV 1** - accepts CV control for cutoff frequency
*   **CV 2** - additional CV control for cutoff frequency

### Outputs

*   **OUT** - the signal after being filtered.
*   **MULT** - an unbuffered multiple (a passive bi-directional circuit for mixing/splitting signals).
*   **BUS CV** - this sits below the input jacks on the left side and will output CV pitch from a connected MIDI device
*   **BUS CTRL** - this sits below the input jacks on the left side and will output a volatge dervied from MIDI control message (CC20) from a connected MIDI device.

### Controls

*   **FREQ Knob** - Sets the cuttoff frequency of the filter.
*   **CV 1 Knob** - controls the amount CV1 input affects the Cutoff frequency.
*   **RESONANCE Knob** - sets the amount of amplification of the frequencies on/around the cut off point.
*   **LP/BP** Switch - Switches the filter between letting low frequencies past, or also removing/lowering higher frequencies as well.
*   **DIST** switch - Adds an overdrive/distortion to the output signal.
*   **FM** switch - adds some of the main input signal to the modulation of the cutoff point.
*   **HARD/SOFT** switch - changes the overall sound/character of the filter so you get two for the price of one.

### Patch Suggestions

With its great sonic character it is highly recommended for bass and lead sounds.

This module does not have CV control of resonance, but it can be created by putting one of the filter outputs through a VCA whose level is controlled by the CV modulation source (e.g. LFO or envelope), then feeding the VCA output back into the same filter - you may need a mixer module, or use a mult if necessary as the levels on the 2 inputs are different. Try the low input for the feed back from the VCA first....

Here are a few videos which show off the great character of this filter:

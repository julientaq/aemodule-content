This 1/3 height micro module provides various logic gates and inverted functions. There are 4 channels for logic operations, two channels for two signals to be combined using either NAND, AND or XOR logic and two channels for inverting a signal.

This module needs to be installed on the [µBASE](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/UBASE) module!

This module works exactly like the bigger [LOGIC](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/LOGIC) module. Please check its wiki page for more information, and patch suggestions.

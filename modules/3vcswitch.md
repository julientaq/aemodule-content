This module gives you 3 separate switches, controllable from the buttons on the front panel or via the gate inputs. Each circuit can be used bidirectionally; i.e a signal can be sent to one of two destinations or one of two signals can be selected to go to the output.

Module power consumption: 4 mA

### Inputs

*   **IO1** - Circuit 1's in/out going to/from 1A or 1B
*   **Gate1** - a +5V pulse here switches from 1A to 1B or from 1B to 1A
*   **IO2** - Circuit 2's in/out going to/from 2A or 2B
*   **Gate2** - a +5V pulse here switches from 2A to 2B or from 2B to 2A
*   **IO3** - Circuit 3's in/out going to/from 3A or 3B
*   **Gate3** - a +5V pulse here switches from 3A to 3B or from 3B to 3A
*   **+5V** - actually an output giving +5V, the maximum the AE Modular can deal with. Very useful for further processing via this module or others for modulation.
*   **Bus Gate** - This output gives a +5V signal whilst an external midi device key on is pressed, via the Master module.

### Outputs

*   **1A** - Circuit 1's A in/out
*   **1B** - Circuit 1's B in/out
*   **2A** - Circuit 2's A in/out
*   **2B** - Circuit 2's B in/out
*   **3A** - Circuit 3's A in/out
*   **3B** - Circuit 3's B in/out

### Controls

The panel is marked 1,2 and 3 for each circuit, the controls are the same for each.

*   **Latch** button. - When this button is pressed it moves the connection from A to B or B to A.
*   **MMT** button. - When this button is pressed output/input on A is switched to B, or vice versa, but only whilst the switch is pressed, i.e. it is a momentary button.

### Patch Suggestions

There is a patch challenge for this module on the forum. Here you can find more interesting uses of this module: [http://forum.aemodular.com/thread/313/patch-challenge-pulling-old-switcheroo](http://forum.aemodular.com/thread/313/patch-challenge-pulling-old-switcheroo)

This module is excellent for providing variation in rhythms/ sequences by cutting a trigger in or out via the buttons if "playing" the AE modular, or the gate inputs - the latter can be done with an LFO, envelope or one of the sequencer modules. It works really well with the [TRIQ164](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/TRIQ164) and the (discontinued) [Step 10](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/STEP10) modules. The [SEQ16](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/SEQ16) module main out can work with a bit of care, but it works really well using of one of the various gate outputs to the 3VCSwitch, especially combined with the [Logic module](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/LOGIC) to vary things further.

It is useful where you want to automate switching between 2 audio paths, (e.g. 2 different filters) as part of a patch.

It can be used to create Stereo from mono by going 1 in to 2 out, (thanks to [Tuesday Night Machines](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeMusic/TheTuesdayNightMachines) for this one). He suggests "now use a square VCO to quickly switch that audio signal between the ears for crazy effects".

Other trigger/ trigger variation modules, like the Divider (discontinued), [Trip](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/TRIP), [MM Divider](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/MM-DIV) and, particularly the [Topograf](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/TOPOGRAF) combine with the 3VCSwitch for endless possibilities.

Below is a video by [the5thvolt](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/Profiles/The5thvolt) a with various patch ideas: [https://youtu.be/ddANhDYMVh0](https://youtu.be/ddANhDYMVh0)

This video is for a Eurorack module similar to the 3VCSWITCH, and so gives some more ideas you may want to explore.

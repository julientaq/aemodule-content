This 1/3 height micro module provides a two independant channels for a signal amplifier which is very similar to the [2SIGNALAMP](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/2SIGNALAMP) module.

This module needs to be installed on the [µBASE](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/UBASE) module!

Module power consumption: ? mA

### Inputs

*   **IN 1, IN 2** - inputs for each of the amplifying channels

### Outputs

*   **OUT 1, OUT 2** - outputs for each of the amplifying channels

### Controls

*   **LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2** Pot - Level control for how much the relevant signal will be amplified.

### Patch Suggestions

Some modules in the AE system produce very low volume or signal levels, eg. GRAINS, VCO, (particularly the triangle wave), and sometimes the SOLINA . With the SIGNALAMP you can increase the signal of these modules so they can hold their own in a mix with other much stronger signals. Also can be useful to boost heavily filtered audio....

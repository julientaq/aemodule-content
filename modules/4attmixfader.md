4ATTMIX FADER is functionally identical with the [4ATTMIX module](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/4ATTMIX), but instead of potentiometers there are faders which are convenient in certain situations where values are to be changed simultaneously, It is also easier to see the current levels at a glance, excellent for VCO mixing.

Module power consumption: 2 mA

### Inputs

*   **IN 1-4** - signal inputs for each attenuator

### Outputs

*   **OUT 1-4** - individual outputs for the relevant signal in.
*   **MIX** - Signals from inputs 1 to 4 combined as set by controls below.
*   **+5V** (x2) - static 5V outputs
*   **Bus Ctrl** - Midi CC20 CV from Master I/O module
*   **Bus Gate** - gate signal from the Master I/O MIDI to CV converter

### Controls

*   **LEVEL 1-4** faders - reduce the strength of the incoming signals 1-4
*   **MIX** switches - adds/ removes the input signals from the mix output
*   **DC AUDIO** switch - switches the module between DC-coupled (0-5V) and AC-coupled (signal centered around 2.5V, sometimes useful for audio signals) operation

### Patch Suggestions

Please see the [4ATTMIX module](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/4ATTMIX) page.

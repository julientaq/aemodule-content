An extremely useful module to have if you want to interface other equipment with your AE modular. The most important job is to prevent a CV outside the 0 to +5 volts range from entering the AE system as this would damage it.


### Inputs

*   **I/O 1** - 3.5mm jack socket - mono signal sent to I/O patch socket 1
*   **I/O 2** - 3.5mm jack socket - signal sent to I/O patch socket 2
*   **I/O 3** - 3.5mm jack socket - mono signal sent to I/O patch socket 3
*   **I/O 4** - 3.5mm jack socket - signal sent to I/O patch socket 4

They are labelled I/O as you can also send the signal input into the AE patch in/outs (in the AE system's usual location for outputs) and out to your external equipment via these sockets

If a stereo 3.5mm plug is used into sockets 1 or 3, the signals are output on patch in/outs 1/2 and 3/4 respectively.

### Outputs

*   **I/O 1** - This will output the signal from the I/O 1 3.5mm socket above, or send one to it.
*   **I/O 2** -This will output the signal from the I/O 2 3.5mm socket above, or send one to it.
*   **I/O 3** - This will output the signal from the I/O 3 3.5mm socket above, or send one to it.
*   **I/O 4** - This will output the signal from the I/O 4 3.5mm socket above, or send one to it.
    
*   **Mult** - A passive mixing/ splitter with no connections to main module circuits.

### Controls

*   **AUD/DC Switch** - 1 for each 3.5mm socket - selects audio signal or CV type signal. For the AE this means a CV is 0 volts to 5V, with 0 as the base, for audio it "rotates" around 2.5 volts but still is 0 to 5 volts. If things are quite as expected, try the switch in the other position.

### Patch Suggestions

This module is great for bringing in other synth's modulation CVs, (especially envelopes where you can do more complex things than the AE currently can). By using 2 or more of the 4 channels, you can bring in an external Gate/CV from a sequencer or keyboard.

It can also be used to sync non midi equipment with the AE's sequencer modules.

It can also be useful to bring in external audio for processing within the AE system.

It's also great for sending the AE's audio out to a mixer or recording device with line level. Just patch in the output of the [MultiFX](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/MULTIFX) into I/O1+2 and then you can use a stereo cable from the first jack without the need of splitter cables as you would have to use on the master module.

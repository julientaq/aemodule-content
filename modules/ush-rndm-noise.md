This 1/3 height micro module is jam packed with features such as:

*   2 channel Track or Sample & Hold
*   Noise
*   Random clock

This module needs to be installed on the [µBASE](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/UBASE) module!

Module power consumption: ? mA

### Inputs

*   **IN 1** - the audio to be "sampled" on channel 1.
*   **TRG 1** - when activated the module takes a voltage measurement from input 1.
*   **IN 2** - the audio to be "sampled" on channel 2.
*   **TRG 2/CLK** - when activated the module takes a voltage measurement from input 2 and can also act as clock for the random CV output.

### Outputs

*   **1** - S&H output channel 1
*   **2** - S&H output channel 2
*   **R** - Noise
*   **CLK** - Random Clock

### Controls

*   **T&H / S&H** Switch - changes the behaviour of either sampling the input and holding that voltage at the trigger point, or tracking the input when the trigger is positive; these cause very different CVs to be produced by the module from the same input.
    
*   **TAP / MODE** Button - tapping the button a few times sets the speed of the random value changes.

Tapping the button only one time: The random value output is updated when the input TRIG2 gets a trigger signal / it's synced to TRIG2 input.

**Mode display and changing:**

Holding the button displays the currently set mode:

1x: (audio) noise output

2x: random CV

3x: random CV, smoothed

To change the mode: Hold the button longer until the desired mode (= number of LED flashes) is displayed, then release the button. The mode and selected speed is saved when powered off.

### Patch Suggestions

This module is very similar to the combination of [NOISE](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/NOISE) and [SAMPLEHOLD](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/SAMPLEHOLD) and all the patch suggestions for those modules apply here as well.

Track and hold is a very unusual function to be offered even in modular world, it can be a very interesting source of CVs; it can also be used to generate a semi-repetitive CV depending on the input.

The NOISE module generates ... yes ... noise!

There are three types of noise in the module: analog, digital and crackle. See **outputs** below for details.

### Inputs

*   **CV** - control voltage input for RATE (see below)

### Outputs

*   **A OUT** (2x) - analog noise: a fluctuating voltage between about 1v and 4V
*   **D OUT** - digital noise: a random changing 0V / 5V
*   **CR OUT** - crackle noise: random triggers (on newer versions)
*   **MULT**, labelled **Thru** on the picture here - passive signal splitter/multiplier
*   **BUS CV** - MIDI pitch signal from the bus
*   **BUS CTRL** - MIDI control signal from the bus (CH1 - CC20)

### Controls

*   **RATE Knob** - controls the color of the noise, which goes from almost white noise on A output and knob fully clockwise to a rather harsh and digital sound on D output and RATE counter-clockwise.â€‹ It also controls the density of the crackle on CR output.

### Patch Suggestions

A popular patch is to connect A OUT to a VCA (IN) controled by an envelope to get percusive sounds.

Use D OUT for harsher bit-crushed sounds.

Connecting CR OUT to S&H (TRIG1) and A OUT to [S&H](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/SAMPLEHOLD) outputs random voltages at intervals set by the trig input on that module.

When used as audio, CR OUT gives a nice vinyl-like crackle sound.

If used through an attenuator (e.g. [2ATTCV](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/2ATTCV)) it can be nice as a random modulation source on things like filter cut off.

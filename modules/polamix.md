The POLAMIX is similar to the [2CVTOOL](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/2CVTOOL) in that you can offset, attenuate and invert signals, but it also acts as a 3 channel mixer. Try to use this with 3 LFOs for modulation mayhem!

Module power consumption: 2 mA

### Inputs

*   **IN 1** - accepts any CV or audio signal
*   **IN 2** - accepts any CV or audio signal
*   **IN 3** - accepts any CV or audio signal

### Outputs

*   **Bus CV** - CV signal from MIDI
*   **Bus CTRL** - CTRL signal from MIDI
*   **OUT** (x2) - output of the 3 channel mix
*   **MULT** - passive multiple, not connected to the module's circuitry

### Controls

*   **OFFSET** - Boost or lower the overall level of the output
*   **LEVEL 1** - Boost or lower the signal level of input 1.
*   **LEVEL 2** - As above for channel 2.
*   **LEVEL 3** - As above for channel 3.

### Patch Suggestions

This module is excellent for combining CVs, e.g. an [Envelope](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/ADSR) and [LFO](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/2LFO) to go to one destination (e.g. Filter cut off frequency); you can set the level of modulation for each of 3 CVs input, and this is very tweakable during a performance.

It makes an excellent submixer to combine the [oscillator](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/2OSCD) outputs for different timbres, this could be the multiple outputs from one VCO or up to 3 separate ones...

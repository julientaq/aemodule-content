**Filter Module Comparison Table August 22.**

Filter Types normally refers to high, low and bandpass but a couple of modules offer more.

An attenuator controlled input means there is a knob on the module to control the level of that input.

[Kuzmin Filter](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/KUZMINFILTER)

*   $ = See below.
*   A = Almost, but not self resonant.
*   N = little/no self resonance
*   Y = Will self resonate.

There should also be a honourable mention to the [Dead Band](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/KeuerslagerkurtDeadBand) module, by Keurslager Kurt. This could be considered a notch filter, but you look at the Wiki page and decide for yourself.....

Notes
-----

*   The **MS20 Filter** is excellent for Kick/bass drum sounds, toms etc. Turn the resonance up!
*   The **Nyle (Steiner type) Filter** is the only AE filter with a CV input for resonance level. It also can mix up to 3 different filters on one output.
*   The **State Variable Filter** has 3 outs for the low and bandpass filters, and 2 for the highpass filter. It also has excellent self resonance.
*   The **Wasp Filter** has 3 outs for the low and bandpass filters, and 2 for the highpass filter. It is a characterful filter.
*   The **Diode Filter** is obviously great for TB303 impressions/baselines etc. Two of the CV ins are for "Accent", i.e. lift cutoff freq &/or volume.
*   The **Kuzmin Filter** is the most characterful AE filter, and can be really grungy/dirty. It has a built in distortion circuit you can turn on/off. It also has Frequency Modulation of the cutoff point (on/off via a switch), and another switch which can make the resonance "hard" or "soft".

More seriously it means regular studio leads can be used which generally give better audio quality and, probably, more reliable connection. They also come in much longer lengths if needed....

If you are also adding the XLR outputs, ideally this module should be attached first, then the [MIXCONXLR](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/MIXCONXLROUT) ...

This module is discontinued, replaced by the 2LFO module

The low frequency oscillator (LFO) module generates modulation voltages mostly below the audio range.

Module power consumption: 3 mA

### Inputs

*   **SYNC** - resets the LFO waveform when a trigger pulse is received
*   **PWM** - control voltage input for pulse width modulation of PULSE wave output

### Outputs

*   **SQUARE** - low frequency square wave with fixed width (half cycle)
*   **TRIANGLE / SAWTOOTH** - low frequency triangle or sawtooth wave
*   **PULSE** (L) - low frequency pulse where pulse length is set by the PULSEWIDTH knob
*   **BUS CV** - control voltage signal from MIDI
*   **BUS CTRL** - CTRL signal from MIDI (CH1 - CC20)

### Controls

*   **RATE knob** - frequency control
*   **PULSEWIDTH knob** - set the pulse width of the output
*   **SLOW / FAST switch** - switch between two frequency ranges
*   **TRIANGLE / SAWTOOTH switch** - choose the waveform of the TRIANGLE / SAWTOOTH output
*   **TRIANGLE LED** - visual reference for the TRIANGLE / SAWTOOTH output
*   **PULSE LED** - visual reference for the PULSE output

### Patch Suggestions

LFO can be used for modulating other oscillators (FM), VCAs (AM), filters, etc. But may also be used as clock or gate.

Patching two unsynched LFOs through a logic module then to a sequencer creates interesting uneven rhythms. Changing their pulsewidth creates new rhythms.

Combined LFOs connected to CV switches or a multiplexer results in a simple and versatile trigger sequencer.

When cranked up to audio range (RANGE knob all the way to the right in FAST mode) may be used as audio oscillator.

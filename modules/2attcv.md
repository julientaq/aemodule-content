You can also switch to voltage mode and get a manually controllable CV on the output(s).

### Inputs

- **IN1** - accept any CV or audio signal
- **IN2** - accept any CV or audio signal

### Outputs

- **Bus CV** - CV signal from MIDI
- **Bus Gate** - Gate signal from MIDI
- **1** - attenuated signal from IN1
- **2** - attenuated signal from IN2

### Controls

- **Switch IN1/+5** - switch between attenuating signal from IN1 or issue CV between 0-5V
- **Switch IN2/+5** - switch between attenuating signal from IN2 or issue CV between 0-5V
- **Pot Level 1** - depending on switch 1 attenuate signal from IN1 or select CV level between 0-5V
- **Pot Level 2** - depending on switch 2 attenuate signal from IN1 or select CV level between 0-5V

### Patch Suggestions

Attenuating CV can be very useful in a lot of situations. A simple example is to control the tonal range of a sample and hold patch, where the output of the S&H can be attenuated to a smaller pitch range before being sent to an oscillator. A common one to to control the level of filter modulation, but the most common is the amount of vibrato (pitch "wobble") by routing the LFO through this module.

This video describes how to use the [SAMPLE&HOLD](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/SAMPLEHOLD) module and makes use of the 2ATT/CV module for controlling pitch:

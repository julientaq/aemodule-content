                <p>An extremely useful module to have if you want to interface other equipment with your AE modular. The most important job is to prevent a CV outside the 0 to +5 volts range from entering the AE system as this would damage it.</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>I/O 1</strong> - 3.5mm jack socket - mono signal sent to I/O patch socket 1</li>
<li><strong>I/O 2</strong> - 3.5mm jack socket - signal sent to I/O patch socket 2</li>
<li><strong>I/O 3</strong> - 3.5mm jack socket - mono signal sent to I/O patch socket 3</li>
<li><strong>I/O 4</strong> - 3.5mm jack socket - signal sent to I/O patch socket 4</li>
</ul>
<p>They are labelled I/O as you can also send the signal input into the AE patch in/outs (in the AE system's usual location for outputs) and out to your external equipment via these sockets</p>
<p>If a stereo 3.5mm plug is used into sockets 1 or 3, the signals are output on patch in/outs 1/2 and 3/4 respectively.</p>
<h3>Outputs</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I/O 1</strong> - This will output the signal from the I/O 1 3.5mm socket above, or send one to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I/O 2</strong> -This will output the signal from the I/O 2 3.5mm socket above, or send one to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I/O 3</strong> - This will output the signal from the I/O 3 3.5mm socket above, or send one to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I/O 4</strong> - This will output the signal from the I/O 4 3.5mm socket above, or send one to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mult</strong> - A passive mixing/ splitter with no connections to main module circuits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Controls</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AUD/DC Switch</strong> - 1 for each 3.5mm socket - selects audio signal or CV type signal. For the AE this means a CV is 0 volts to 5V, with 0 as the base, for audio it &quot;rotates&quot; around 2.5 volts but still is 0 to 5 volts. If things are quite as expected, try the switch in the other position.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Patch Suggestions</h3>
<p>This module is great for bringing in other synth's modulation CVs, (especially envelopes where you can do more complex things than the AE currently can). By using 2 or more of the 4 channels, you can bring in an external Gate/CV from a sequencer or keyboard.</p>
<p>It can also be used to sync non midi equipment with the AE's sequencer modules.</p>
<p>It can also be useful to bring in external audio for processing within the AE system.</p>
<p>It's also great for sending the AE's audio out to a mixer or recording device with line level. Just patch in the output of the <a href="https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/MULTIFX">MultiFX</a> into I/O1+2 and then you can use a stereo cable from the first jack without the need of splitter cables as you would have to use on the master module.</p>

The DRUMKIT 010 consists of 11 8-bit drum sound samples; 6 of them can be triggered in parallel in any combination by the trigger inputs.Don't expect high quality from this module - it's by design a nasty, lo-fi drum sound source, but definitely with its own character. Works great together with the [analog KICK module](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/KICK).

Module power consumption: 3 mA

### Inputs

*   **BD** - trigger for bass drum
*   **SD** - trigger for snare drum
*   **CP** - trigger for clap
*   **CH** - trigger for closed hi-hat
*   **OH** - trigger for open hi-hat
*   **FX** - trigger for FX sound
*   **PITCH CV** - cv control of pitch for all sounds
*   **ACCENT** - trigger for accent

### Outputs

*   **OUT** - audio output of mix of all sounds
*   **MULT** - unbuffered multiple

### Controls

*   **BANK** Knob - select a bank of sounds, this selects different sounds for the 6 channels. Because there are only 11 sounds in total, each bank is a different mix of 6 of those sounds.
*   **PITCH** Knob - select the pitch of all sound samples
*   **REVERSE** Button - while pressed, all samples will play in reverse
*   **TRIG MODE** Switch - if set to A any rising signal will trigger, if set to D a short pulse is expected.

### Patch Suggestions

The DRUMKIT works best when triggered by either the [TOPOGRAF](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/TOPOGRAF), [TRIQ 164](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/TRIQ164) or [MM-DIV](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/MM-DIV) modules.

Some older versions of this module are a bit low in volume, so patching the output through the [2SIGNALAMP](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/2SIGNALAMP) will boost the signal to be on par with other voices in the system.

One of the great things you can do within modular is combine sounds; this module can be used to put an a noise on the attack part of a sustaining sound from a VCO; Roland D50 Sound and Synthesis for 10% of the price!

The drum sounds from this module can, of course, be processed by the rest of your AE system; [Lo-fi delay](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/DELAY), Filters and [Kurt's Deadband](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/KeuerslagerkurtDeadBand) are highly recommended.

A signal amplifier module, i.e. you can make a signal louder/stronger. There are 2 separate circuits in this module, with a maximum gain of 15-1.

Module power consumption: 2 mA

### Inputs

*   **In 1** - input for circuit one.
*   **In 2** - input for circuit two.
*   **Mult** - a passive mixer/splitter completely separate to the module circuits.

### Outputs

*   **Out 1** (2) - output of circuit one.
*   **Out 2** (2) - output of circuit two.
*   **Mult** - a passive mixer/splitter completely separate to the module circuits.

Please note that the input side **Mult** is separate to the output side **Mult** and both are bidirectional (i.e. use any socket(s) for in or out).

### Controls

*   **Level 1** knob - sets gain level of input 1, i.e the more clockwise you turn the knob the louder the output. If the Clip LED lights you have hit the maximum level the AE Modular can cope with
*   **Level 2** knob - sets gain level of input 2, i.e the more clockwise you turn the knob the louder the output. If the Clip LED lights you have hit the maximum level the AE Modular can cope with

### Patch Suggestions

As Robert suggest on the Tangible Waves website, this module is usually used to boost the triangle wave signal from the VCO, or external signals (usually via the [4 I/O module](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/4IO)).

It can also be useful to boost the general signal level before the AE modular goes to an external mixer or recorder etc. It can boost signals coming into the AE also, but please put them through the 4I/O or [Master](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/MASTER)/[Power](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/POWER) modules first.

It can also be used as a simple mixer by putting the 2 outs into a Mult with another cable going from there to the next stage, can be useful for VCOs to save your [4ATT/Mix](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/4ATTMIXFADER) module for other work.

It can be overdriven to creating signal alteration/distortion.....

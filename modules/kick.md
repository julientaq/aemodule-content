Analogue drum machine style kick (bass) drum

Module power consumption: 3 mA

### Inputs

*   **Trig** - use a pulse to activate the module sound, usually via one of the divider modules, or the Topograf module.
*   **Mult** - a passive signal mixing/splitting capability on several AE modules, no control of signal levels within the module.
*   **Bus Gate** - +5V with key on from an external keyboard over midi via the master module.

### Outputs

*   **Out** (3) - signal out.
*   **Mult** - passive signal mixing/splitting, no control of signal levels within the module.

### Controls

*   **Pitch** - sets basic pitch of sound
*   **Decay** - sets how long it takes the sound to stop after triggering.
*   **Drive** - more drive adds roughness/buzz and volume.
*   **Pitch Decay** Switch - The Decay can also cause the pitch to drop as well as volume. 1980's Simmons drums...
*   **Trig** - direct, manual triggering of module - very useful.

### Patch Suggestions

The Kick module doesn't go very low in Pitch for modern tastes, going through one of the filters can fix this - the [Nyle Filter](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/NYLEFILTER) is recommended.

The [Lo Fi delay](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/DELAY) can be fun...

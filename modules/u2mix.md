This 1/2 height micro module provides a tiny mixer with 3 attenuated channels and 4 fixed channels.

This module needs to be installed on the [µBASE](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/UBASE) module!

Module power consumption: ? mA

### Inputs

*   **IN A1, A2, A3** - These are inputs to the attenuated (via the pots) channel of the Mixer
*   **IN A3b** - This input will be mixed together with input 3 and attenuated at the same time
    
*   **IN B1, B2, B3, B4** - These inputs are mixed together without manual attenuation, however by choosing to insert via the 1.0 or 0.3 inputs you can add the signals either at full or a third of their strength.

### Outputs

*   **OUT A** Mix from attenuated mix inputs (A)
*   **OUT B** Mix from unattenuated mix inputs (B)

### Controls

*   **A1, A2, A3** Pot - Volume attenuation of the channels 1 - 3

### Patch Suggestions

This can be used for Audio or CV mixing of signals and is very similar to the [MIXER 4-4](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/MIXER44) module.

            <h2>Connect Power</h2>
<p>There are a few ways in which you can connect your AE Modular system to a power source.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: Make sure that any power source that you connect to your AE Modular is Volts and centre positive! This is different from common guitar pedals, which are centre negative. If in doubt, use a multimeter to test.</strong></p>
<h3>Use the mains power adapter</h3>
<p>This adapter would have been delivered as part of the package if you have ordered either a Standard Rack 1 or Rack 2. You just connect the adapter to a nearby mains power outlet and plug in the little cable into the Master module. If you don't have an adapter, <a href="https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p23/Power_Supply_Adapter_9V_1.3A.html">you can find one here.</a></p>
<h3>Connect to a USB charger</h3>
<p>USB chargers put out 5 Volts which needs to be converted to 9 Volts for the AE Modular. You can find USB 5V to 9V converters relatively cheap on eBay.</p>
<h3>Connect a USB battery pack</h3>
<p>Just like the USB charger method above, you would simply connect a 5V to 9V USB converter into a standard mobile phone battery pack and then power the AE Modular from this. You can easily power a 2 row system from a 10,000 mA/h battery pack for over 4 hours.</p>
<h2>Connect Audio</h2>
<p>There are two ways of making the AE patch leads connect to a 3.5mm mini jack for signals coming in or out.</p>
<p>On the Master module there is Audio I/O 1 and Audio I/O 2. These are bi-directional connections, but usually I/O 1 will be your output from the AE, the output from the last module in your patch needs to be connected to the Aud I/O1 socket, then the signal is at the Audio I/O 1 3.5mm socket on the front panel, to then take your patch to the mixer / monitor / recording system. I/O 2 is exactly the same, so can be useful for stereo patches. They can also be used to bring sound into the AE for processing.</p>
<p>The other method is by the 4 I/O module; this works in exactly the same way, but has switches so you can use control voltages (CVs) or audio in either direction.</p>
<p>There is a headphone amp module in the AE range, if you are wanting to listen just to the AE, this is highly recommended, and means you can set up a patch without having to have the rest of your studio on.</p>

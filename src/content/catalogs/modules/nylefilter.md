The NYLE FILTER is an adaptation of the Steiner Filter for the AE modular system. It contains the classic filter types lowpass, highpass and bandpass with adjustable filter frequency and resonance. The unique feature of this filter type is that there are separate inputs for the different filter types (not separate outputs as with other filters). Each input has its own attenuator. This allows quite unusual sounds, if different signals are fed into the different inputs.

It is an unusual filter in that the cutoff resonance can be CV controlled, a major reason to add this to your AE system. This is really useful for varying sequences and melodic sounds in particular.

The sound goes from quite soft filtering with low resonance setting to a quite intense resonance peak to full self-resonance. On newer models there is a switch to change the resonance characteristics from "wild" to "tamed".

Module power consumption: 2 mA

### Inputs

*   **LP IN** - audio signal going through the Lowpass curve of the filter
*   **BP IN** - audio signal going through the Bandpass curve of the filter
*   **HP IN** - audio signal going through the Highpass curve of the filter
*   **CV 1** - accepts CV control for cutoff frequency, this will affect all three filter curves
*   **CV 2** - additional CV control for cutoff frequency, this will also affect all three filter curves
*   **CV Resonance** - CV control for the resonance

### Outputs

*   **OUT** (3) - the combined and mixed output of the filtered input signals
*   **MULT** (5) - a multiple which is disconnected from the filter circuitry
*   **BUS CV** - this sits below the input jacks on the left side and will output CV pitch from a connected MIDI device
*   **BUS CTRL** - this sits below the input jacks on the left side and will output the MIDI control message from a connected MIDI device (CC20).

### Controls

*   **LOWPASS IN** - attenuator for the level of the signal from **LP IN** before it gets passed into the lowpass signal path.
*   **BANDPASS IN** - attenuator for the level of the signal from **BP IN** before it gets passed into the bandpass signal path.
*   **HIGHPASS IN** - attenuator for the level of the signal from **HP IN** before it gets passed into the highpass signal path.
*   **FREQUENCY** - controls the cutoff frequency for all filter types
*   **CV 1** - attenuates the effect of the CV 1 control voltage input
*   **CV 2** - attenuates the effect of the CV 2 control voltage input
*   **RESONANCE** - controls the resonance of the filters
*   **WILD/TAME** - on newer models this switch controls the resonance behaviour

### Patch Suggestions

Put a LFO through an attenuator so you can control the amount (e.g. 2CVTOOL), to the resonance CV input is great for creating variations on the sound, subtle or mad....

By using the various filter type inputs, this module can be used to combine sounds and, in effect, mix them by tweaking the filter controls. Try a Kick drum through the Lowpass, strings/pad through the bandpass and a percussion sound though the highpass filter.

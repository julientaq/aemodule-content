The CVSHIFTER module controls 4 outputs from one CV input; what the outputs do depend on the mode the user chooses.

*   **Classic** - Each trigger in shifts the CV out by one position, the new CV goes to output CV 1. The CV that was at output 1 goes to output 2 and so on. This means you need to have 4 triggers before there is a CV at output 4. This mode will not produce triggers at the TRIG 1-4 outputs. This mode means you can generate chords within your AE modular.
*   **Cycle** - Each trigger sends the CV to the next output channel with a gate signal at the relevant output, after output 4 it cycles back to output 1. This can be excellent for percussion tracks.
*   **Random** - The CVs are sent in random order to one of the four outputs, with a gate at the relevant output.

Power Consumption: 12 mA

### Inputs

*   **CV** - the input CV which is sampled with each trigger pulse
*   **TRIG** - the trigger input which samples the input CV and sends the output to one of the outputs
*   **TRIG SLOW** - ?
*   **RESET** - reset the sequence

### Outputs

*   **CV1** - The first output of the sequence
*   **CV2** - The second output of the sequence
*   **CV3** - The third output of the sequence
*   **CV4** - The fourth output of the sequence
*   **TRIG1** - When in CYCLE mode this sends a trigger on the first step of the sequence, in RANDOM mode, when output 1 is selected.
*   **TRIG2** - When in CYCLE mode this sends a trigger on the second step of the sequence, in RANDOM mode, when output 2 is selected.
*   **TRIG3** - When in CYCLE mode this sends a trigger on the third step of the sequence, in RANDOM mode, when output 3 is selected.
*   **TRIG4** - When in CYCLE mode this sends a trigger on the fourth step of the sequence, in RANDOM mode, when output 4 is selected.

### Controls

*   **MODE** - cycles through the 3 modes explained above.
*   **RESET** - performs a manual reset of the sequence, so the next CV will be on output 1 only.
*   **MAN TRIG** - manual trigger for a CV sample/next step in the sequence.

### Display

The 4 leds light when the relevent output has a CV present.

### Patch Suggestions

Compared to the "classic" circuits, this module is digital based and therefore doesn't suffer from drift as some analogue ASRs and S&Hs do. The result is, that you can control the pitch of up to four oscillators which can be a move into polyphony. The first step is to do a paraphonic synth, which means the four oscillators go through one filter and VCA. If you have a keyboard connected to your AE, the Key CV (BUS CV if using a midi keyboard) and trigger (BUS GATE if using midi) need to go to the CVShifter inputs; experiment from there!

This module can be excellent for producing CVs that are used to modulate a sequence; you can run the triggers so that they are triggered every step of the sequence (e.g. using the out on the [SEQ8](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/SEQ8)), a specific step using the numbered outs or, where it can get really interesting, is using one of the 4 sequences in the [TRIQ164](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/TRIQ164) or [Euclid Grid](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/KyaaEuclid)....

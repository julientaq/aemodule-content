The SAWVOX module is a “complete” synth voice with two sawtooth oscillators, a filter and a VCA, all realized digitally with a tiny 8-bit microcontroller. The oscillators are detuned by a fixed rate to get a fatter sound, and can be switched to a single oscillator. Of course, due to the limited resources of the processor, the sound has the typical 8-bit lofi char, but the CV tracking is quite fine, and it can find its place in a lot of patches. All parameters can be CV controlled, eg. filter frequency and resonance.

The module is based on a simple 8-bit microcontroller and an adapted design of Jan Ostman.

Module power consumption: 30 mA

### Inputs

*   **CV1** - CV frequency control
*   **CV2** - additional frequency control which is added to CV1
*   **FLT CV** - filter cutoff frequency control
*   **RES CV** - filter resonance control
*   **AMP CV** - VCA amplitude control

### Outputs

*   **OUT** - audio output signal
*   **MULT** - multiple disconnected from module circuitry
*   **B.CV** - CV signal from MIDI bus
*   **B.CTRL** - MIDI CTRL signal from the bus

### Controls

*   **PITCH** (pot) - select the base frequency of the oscillator
*   **FILTER** (pot) - select the cutoff frequency of the built-in filter
*   **RESONANCE** (pot) - select the resonance of the filter
*   **OSCILLATORS** (switch) - select 1 or 2 oscillators. If 2 is selected the second oscillator is detuned to the first one at a fixed rate.
*   **+2 OCT** (switch) - if set to the top position the frequency is shifted up 2 octaves

### Patch Suggestions

Though technically a "complete" voice it obviously can be processed further within the AE system. [PHASER](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/PHASER) and [Lofi Delay](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/DELAY) are particularly recommended....

If you haven't got the fine control you desire for a particular patch then, as an example, if you leave the Sawvox filter fully open you can patch the output to another AE filter to have more parameters/adjustments available.

Here is a video by The 5th Volt which features this module.

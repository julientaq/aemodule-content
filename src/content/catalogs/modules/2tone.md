2TONE is a dual bass-treble tone control, that is a quite useful companion for the [MIXCONSOLE](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/MIXCONSOLE), to shape the overall spectrum of individual signal paths.

Module power consumption: 4 mA

## Inputs

*   **IN1** - Audio signal for channel 1
*   **IN2** - Audio signal for channel 2

## Outputs

*   **Out 1** - Adjusted signal for channel 1
*   **Out 2** - Adjusted signal for channel 2

## Controls

*   **HIGH 1** - Adjust the high frequencies for channel 1
*   **LOW 1** - Adjust the low frequencies for channel 1
*   **HIGH 2** - Adjust the high frequencies for channel 2
*   **LOW 2** - Adjust the low frequencies for channel 2

## Patch Suggestions

Use this to raise or lower certain frequencies of a sound source before sending it to the MIXCONSOLE or other mixing module.

It can be useful to free up a [filter module](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/FILTERWASP) is some cases, e.g. roll the top off a bass pitch to make it deeper sounding.

If you want to risk your speakers/headphones, you can feed one channel's output into the input of the other channel so you boost the signal twice.

This 1/3 height micro module provides a distortion effect for the incoming audio signal.

This module needs to be installed on the [µBASE](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/UBASE) module!

Module power consumption: ? mA

## Inputs

*   **IN** - the incoming audio signal

## Outputs

*   **OUT** - the distorted output audio signal

## Controls

*   **DRIVE** Knob - this knob controls the "drive" of the signal, basically it amplifies the signal and overloads the circuits to get the distorted effect.
*   **CLIP** Switch - in the upper position it will clip the edges off the distorted signal for further degradation
*   **SYMM** - ?
*   **HARD** - ?

## Patch Suggestions

This can be used for adding "grit" to a clean sound source. This can be very good on bass or lead sounds.

It can be great to "rough up" a sound with distortion _before_ filtering, especially with the filter resonance in higher settings.

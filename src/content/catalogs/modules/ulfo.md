This 1/3 height micro module provides a tiny LFO with three different waveforms: triangle, sawtooth and square wave. It also offers CV control for pulsewidth modulation for the square wave and a sync input to synchronise the waves with a a reference signal.

This module needs to be installed on the [µBASE](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/UBASE) module!

Module power consumption: ? mA

### Inputs

*   **PW CV** - CV control for pulse width of the square wave
*   **SYNC** - input another LFO or clock source to synchronise waves

### Outputs

*   **OUT** (top) - outputs either a triangle or sawtooth wave depending on the position of the wave switch
*   **OUT** (bottom) - always outputs a square wave

### Controls

*   **PULSE WIDTH** Pot - controls the pulse width of the square wave output
*   **RATE** Pot - controls the frequency of the LFO
*   **Wave** switch - select the output waves, either triangle or sawtooth.

### Patch Suggestions

This can be used like any other LFO, see suggestions at [2LFO](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/2LFO).

The square output is very useful for clocking sequencers, triggering Envelope generators etc.

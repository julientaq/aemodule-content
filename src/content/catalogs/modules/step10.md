This is a discontinued module and is no longer in production. It was replaced with the TRIQ164 Trigger Sequencer module.

## Inputs

*   **Clock** - trigger in to move the Step 10 to the next step. This can be from the Midi Clock, an LFO or any other +5V pulse (e.g. external sequencer)
*   **Reset** - This puts the step count back to the first one regardless of previous position. Use for sequences other than 8 or 10 steps.
*   **B Gate** - Midi Key on/off (external device via Master module)
*   **B CLK** - Midi Clock (96 pulses per quarter note via Master module)
*   **B STRT** - +5V pulse when Midi start is pressed (external device via Master module).\*
*   **B STP** - +5V pulse when Midi Stop is pressed (external device via Master module)

## Outputs

*   **Trig** (2) - +5V pulse with each switch that is on below.
*   **T. INV** - +5V pulse with each switch that is off below.
*   **Thru** (4) - Marked **Mult** on the original modules, passive signal splitter/mixer

## Controls

*   **(10) 8** Switch - 8 or 10 steps in the sequence.
*   **1-4** Switches - Steps 1 to 4 of sequence, trigger or rest depending on position and which output used.
*   **(5)** Switch - Step 5 of a 10 step sequence
*   **5 (6)** Switch - Step 5 of an 8 step, Step 6 of a 10 step sequence.
*   **6 (7)** Switch - Step 6 of an 8 step, Step 7 of a 10 step sequence
*   **7 (8)** Switch - Step 7 of an 8 step, Step 8 of a 10 step sequence
*   **8 (9)** Switch - Step 8 of an 8 step sequence
*   **10** - Step 10 of a 10 step sequence

This seems untidy on paper, but works well as bottom 2 switches are ignored in an 8 step sequence, rather than last 2 switches in right hand column if numbering was the same.

## Patch Suggestions

As a 10 step sequence it is useful to provide variation to the usual 8 or 16 step sequences, whether triggering percussion, providing volume or filter modulation (direct or by triggering an envelope module), or even another sound/pitch. Its set output can be varied via attenuation in the 4ATT/Mix, 2ATT/CV modules etc.

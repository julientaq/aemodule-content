The voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is a typical analog audio oscillator with 1V/Oct pitch tracking for musical purposes. VCOs are one of the most basic audio sources in a synthesizer. Their sound is usually further shaped and refined by filters, wavefolders, voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs) and other audio effects.

Module power consumption: 16 mA

## Inputs

*   **CV1** - control voltage input for pitch frequency (1V/Oct)
*   **CV2** - another control voltage input for pitch frequency (1V/Oct)
*   **MOD** - control voltage input for modulating either frequency or the square wave's pulse width
*   **PW** - dedicated pulse width modulation control voltage input
*   **SYNC** - resets the waveform when a trigger signal is received

## Outputs

*   2x **RAMP** - ramp/sawtooth wave output
*   2x **TRI** - triangle wave output, quieter than the other outputs so it might need amplification via the [2SIGNALAMP](http://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/2SIGNALAMP) module for example
*   2x **SQUARE** - square wave output
*   **BUS CV** - pitch control voltage form the [MASTER I/O](http://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/MASTER) module's MIDI-CV converter

## Controls

*   **MOD DEPTH** Potentiometer - attenuator for the MOD input control voltage
*   **MOD DEPTH** Switch - switches the MOD control voltage target between frequency and pulse width
*   **COARSE** - coarse tuning of the VCO frequency
*   **FINE** - fine tuning of the VCO frequency
*   **PULSEWIDTH** - manual control over the square wave's pulse width, control voltage modulation is added to this potentiometer setting

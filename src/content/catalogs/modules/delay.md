Lo-Fi Delay is a analogue, old fashioned bucket brigade style of delay

Module power consumption: 18 mA

## Inputs

*   **In** - Main incoming audio signal
*   **CV** - CV control of delay time so can do Flanger/Phaser type sounds (with LFO).
*   **In 2** - for 2nd signal in, this will be mixed in without attenuation
*   **In 3** - for 3rd signal in, this will be mixed in without attenuation

## Outputs

*   **Outs** (2) - (mixed signal)
*   **Wet**\- (delay sound only)
*   **Dry** - (original signal(s) only)
*   **Thru** - passive mixing/splitting nothing to do with the delay.

## Controls

*   **Delay** - Set delay time, further impacted by CV control above.
*   **Feedback** - This controls the amount of the output signal that is send back to the input, so you can get reverb type sounds, repeated echoes etc.
*   **Dry/Wet** - This controls the amount of dry (original signal) and wet (the delayed sound) in the output.

## Patch Suggestions

**Dynamic Control** If you want dynamic control of the dry/wet mix, you can use the separate outs and then combine in the [4ATT/Mix](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/4ATTMIX) or [4VCA](https://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/4VCA).

**Bass Sounds** Excellent on bass sounds as is naturally less bright than digital delays.

**CV Control** Using the CV control of the delay time can be done with any CV, not just LFOs. Sequencer CV outs can generate some great rhythmic and/or melodic effects. Envelopes can the same, or do strange FX depending on settings and how they are triggered.

**Other input sources** It can be really interesting on CV rather than audio.....

**Controlling Feedback** The wet signal output and the three mixed inputs makes adding CV control over feedback straightforward. Simply run the wet output to the signal input of a VCA, and run the VCA output to one of the delay inputs. The VCA CV input now controls the amount of feedback. Use a module like the CV Tool to add an offset and attenuate a CV from an LFO or envelope in order to more precisely control the feedback.

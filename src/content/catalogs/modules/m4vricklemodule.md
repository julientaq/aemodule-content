The new (2023) module is a chord generator. It is available via M4vrick on the AE Modular forum, you can read some informations about its development on the forum: [https://forum.aemodular.com/thread/2593/french-home-vco-module-le](https://forum.aemodular.com/thread/2593/french-home-vco-module-le)

## Inputs

- **Frequency** - affects the pitch of the sound
- **Table** - changes the chords, sometimes the harmonics of the sound.
- **Wave** - affects the harmonics and/or chords in the sound.

## Outputs

## Bottom left

- **Bus Gate** - on early modules this is actually the bus CV derived from the midi input on the master module, usually for the pitch.
- **Bus CV** - on early modules this is actually the bus CV derived from the midi input on the master module, usually key on/off.

- **Out 1** - Main output.
- **Out 2** - duplicate output, quite useful for using a different filter &/or FX on.
- **Mult** - a passive splitter/mixer not connected with the module circuitry.

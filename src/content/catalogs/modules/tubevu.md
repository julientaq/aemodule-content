Please note that this module must have a separate 9V power supply to the rest of your AE system, hence the socket on the front! TW do sell one [here](https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p23/Power_Supply_Adapter_9V_1.3A.html).

A brilliant module for people who use their AE live.



### Input

*   **1** - Input for circuit 1
*   **2** - Input for circuit 2
*   **MULT** - a passive mixer/splitter completely separate to the module electronics.

### Output

There are no outputs, as the tubes would produce too higher voltages for the rest of the AE system.

### Control

*   **Level 1** knob - set the level for circuit one so you get the best display...
*   **Level 2** knob - set the level for circuit two so you get the best display...
    
*   **R** knob - sets the amount of red in the colour of the tubes.
*   **G** knob - sets the amount of green in the colour of the tubes.
*   **B** knob - sets the amount of blue in the colour of the tubes.

These last three "knobs" are actually small trimmer pots so you may need a tool to adjust carefully.

### Display

The reason to buy this module!

The left tube displays the status of circuit 1, right circuit 2.

The brighter the tube the louder the signal...

### Patch Suggestions

The main reason for 2 circuits in this module is so you can do stereo, but it can be really good to have 2 different sounds so the Tubes vary individually.

This is the semi-official manual for the AE Modular system from tangible waves. 

This Wiki will, over time, be the main source of information about all things AE Modular - Documentation of all modules, how to connect the system with other synths and other modular formats, how to make and record music and how to build your own modules.

Please Help! We are looking for editors and moderators that can help fill in the gaps and to make this Wiki awesome! Please contact @admin at [http://forum.aemodular.com](http://forum.aemodular.com)
